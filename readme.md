# Getting started
Progeny uses a number of Sass modules which you'll need to install on your system before you can run Grunt to build your them files.
- Compass vertical rhythm
- Susy Grid
- Breakpoint
# Task runner (Grunt)
We use grunt
# Theme options
Have not thought much about theme options yet. Did have an idea about a CPT archive grid type setting
# Includes
Logical grouping of function files. These functions should be writtent so the can be applied anywhere on the site
# Template parts
If you use template parts to reuse HTML markup patterns, put them here.
# Template hierarchy
Use these files to call functions which apply to what the template applies to. Define the functions in the /includes directory so the can be called from anywhere in the site. Defining functions in these files seals them off from use outside the context of this template.
# Styles
